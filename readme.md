# 3D model viewer with AR.js and THREE.js

This project is and example model viewer built with three js. [Live demo here](https://mautar55.github.io/) 

It also has an AR variant that works with phones. 
[Live AR demo here](https://mautar55.github.io/ar/) . This one works by scanning this barcode with the phone's camera (it can be a webcam in a computer too). It relies on the quality of the camera and might not work that well on screens. So do not expect it to work easely.
